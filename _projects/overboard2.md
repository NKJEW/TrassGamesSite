After successfully releasing Overboard to Steam and making it through the first half of our college freshman year, we decided that we wanted to expand Overboard to be bigger and better in every way. Equipped with new skills and unprecedented motivation, we began work on what would eventually become Overboard 2.0.

Overboard 2.0 would feature a full campaign to justify its crazy world, and greatly improved visuals to learn as far into the game's cartoony aesthetic as possible. With cel-shaded graphics and a fancy new water system, Overboard 2.0 promised exciting new features in a much more stylistically recognizable package.

For the rest of the school year and going well into the following summer, the Trass Games team would expand to accommodate the game's massive scope. New assets like the research ship, the deep sea wreckage, and the underwater cliff brought on additional guidance from our new artist Gabriel, and the more involved dynamic music system encouraged Nathan to expand his compositional skills. Jack worked tirelessly on new shaders for set pieces like the abyss and the mysterious alien forcefield, and Jeff gave the team a more professional edge during team meetings and project management.
