After successfully releasing Overboard to Steam and making it through the first half of our college freshman year, we decided that we wanted to expand it, in every sense of the word. Equipped with new skills and unprecedented motivation, we began work on what would eventually become Overboard 2.0.

Overboard 2.0 features a full campaign to justify the ridiculous game concept, and greatly improved visuals to lean as far into the game's cartoony aesthetic as possible. The same explosive shark-filled carnage remains, but with cel-shaded graphics and a fancy new water system, Overboard 2.0 promises exciting new features in a much more stylistically recognizable package.

For the rest of the school year and going well into the following summer, the Trass Games team would expand to accommodate the game's massive scope. New assets like the research ship, the deep sea wreckage, and the underwater cliff brought on additional guidance from our new artist Gabriel, and the more involved dynamic music system encouraged Nathan to expand his compositional skills. Jack worked tirelessly on new shaders for set pieces like the abyss and the mysterious alien forcefield, and Jeff gave the team a more professional edge during team meetings and project management.

Later into the summer we realized we wanted to branch out and explore other projects in VR, putting Overboard on pause. However, even if the project remains unfinished, we are extremely proud of how far it came and all we learned through its development.
