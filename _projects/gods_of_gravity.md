Gods of Gravity is a multiplayer VR game where you play god and compete against your friends for control of a solar system in an epic last-man-standing battle.

Command gravity to capture and throw your fleet in formation. Create wormholes to teleport your ships for a sneak attack!
Take over planets and moons to boost your production. Take over the sun for even more power.
Spread your fleet over the system to maximize your territory. Or mount an attack on an enemy home base!
Fling ships between orbits without tedious real rocket science.
Enjoy the fun, strategic elements of the RTS genre without the overwhelming complexity.
Three distinct ship classes makes combat easy to learn, while still rewarding proper strategic planning.
Various different maps support anywhere from 2-4 players.
Eliminated players automatically join another team so everyone stays in the action.
