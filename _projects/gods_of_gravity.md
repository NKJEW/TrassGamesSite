Gods of Gravity is a multiplayer arcade-style RTS game where you compete against friends in an epic showdown of celestial gods. Scoop up just the right ships (like Shield and Rocket) and fling them to capture a nearby planet, or open wormholes to teleport them across the solar system. Hold planets and moons to boost your production. And if you dare, capture the sun for the ultimate buff. Then send a massive fleet to conquer friendsâ€™ home planets. Last god standing wins.

### 2 to 5 Player Multiplayer:
* Eliminate your friends to take control of the solar system
* Defeated players automatically join another team so everyone stays in the action
* Unlock different Gods with unique powers, but be careful as friends who defeat you will gain them as well
* Add intelligent bots to make the battle even crazier

### Single Player Campaign (BETA):
* Take over the galaxy, one solar system at a time
* Absorb defeated enemies to unlock new Gods with game-changing powers
* Hone your skills on a variety of unique scenarios
