Compete against friends in an epic showdown of celestial gods. Use your gravity power to fling your spaceships into distant orbits, or open wormholes to teleport them across the solar system. Capture planets, moons, and even the sun to boost your production. Then send a massive fleet to conquer friendâ€™s home planets. Last god standing wins.

# Key Features:
* Various different maps support anywhere from 2-4 players.
* Fling ships into distant orbits without tedious rocket science
* The fun, strategic elements of the RTS genre without the overwhelming complexity.
* Three distinct ship classes makes combat easy to learn, while still rewarding proper strategic planning.
* Eliminated players automatically join another team so everyone stays in the action.
