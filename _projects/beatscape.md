Partway into our quarantined summer, we decided to try experimenting with some VR projects that were a complete departure from our previous games. In particular, we were intrigued by the popularity of rhythm games in the VR market, and since Overboard had featured a robust dynamic music system, it seemed like a reasonable direction. So we conceived a new game idea, which would combine the satisfying and intuitive flow of a rhythm game with various forms of combat.

This is Beatscape, a rhythm-based pseudo-roguelike where you use all manner of energy-based weaponry to slash, shoot, and stab your way through the landscape. Enemy encounters require careful timing and precise strikes, and paths are lined with beat patterns that the player must work their way through.

As a whole, this game is designed to be abstract, simple, and straightforward. The art style emphasizes solid colors with clearly defined shapes, and the weapons can be morphed between using basic, intuitive gestures. As a highly experimental project, we have pivoted frequently, trying many different weapons and multiple styles of progression. The concept itself is still in the very early stages of development.
