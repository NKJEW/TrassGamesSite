# From the [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/swipe-and-shoot/id1371819562?ls=1&mt=8):
Swipe and Shoot is a unique iOS game centered around launching your cartoonish soldier into battle in an unlikely effort to save the world from nuclear winter. Made as a remastered version of Swipe and Shoot, we hoped to address the issues with the previous game and fully express our vision for the game.

In the game, you play as a lone soldier tasked with preventing a nuclear strike on your country. As such, you must fight through hordes of cunning enemies with nothing but a few allies, your trusty weapons, and your superhuman ability to launch about the battlefield.

# Development Story
In high school, our focus was mobile game development. We prided ourselves on taking simple and unique game mechanics and trying to expand them into fully fleshed out games. In this case, we wanted to make a game where instead of having your character walk or run, you would flick them to launch them around the map with hilarious physics-based combat.

In freshman year, we made a version of Swipe and Shoot together as our first ever shared project. It was a massive success and a great learning experience, but it lacked the pure essence of what we really wanted from the game mechanics. So two years later, we revisited the concept and rebuilt it from the ground up with a fresh new art style and a more fleshed out campaign, with the hopes of bring justice to the original project.
