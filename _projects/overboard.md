# From the [Steam Page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1144080/Overboard/):
Overboard is a ridiculous VR game about fighting bloodthirsty and increasingly deadly sharks using makeshift weapons. Elevate the battle from the open ocean to the skies, and even into space! The sharks will stop at nothing to devour a tasty human.

# Development Story
One unusual summer day, not long after graduating high school, Jack had a vision. A game where you were swimming the open ocean, ripping and tearing through nonstop waves of murder-hungry sharks, and just watching as a glorious scene of unholy carnage unfolded around you. A game where you were surrounded by constant danger - vulnerable from all sides - and yet simultaneously a loaded powerhouse with weapons capable of obliterating sharks in seconds. A game with a premise so ridiculous, and so crazy, that it just might work.

Overboard's prime appeal came from this over-the-top nature. The player might be building makeshift weaponry from scraps of the sharks' last meal - strapping spear guns to boat propellors and cannons onto jet engines - gradually becoming a more powerful survivor. But all the while, the sharks would be mysteriously gaining upgrades of their own, with jetpacks and space engines, and of course, lasers. As such, the game was designed around this endless battle of escalating proportions, starting in the water but eventually moving into the sky, and even outer space. As a VR experience, this meant putting the player into situations that were so unrealistic and wild that they couldn't help but smile.

Overboard was also the first game we put any effort into marketing, which was a difficult yet rewarding new experience for us. By the end of the summer, we were able to release the game to Steam, and had built up a fairly substantial following on our Discord server. However, we wished we would have put more effort in and the project would have taken off more than it did.
