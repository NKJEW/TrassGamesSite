Indivisible is our entry into the first Oculus Start Game Jam which lasted for 10 days. This years theme was "Overcoming Separation and Fostering Connection".

Our game is about red and blue coming together through compromise to solve our nations problems. Each task represents a current issue in America. However, we only reveal it after the players complete the task.

## Development
After some initial brainstorming, we knew we wanted two players sharing one body. Though we were scared of making a multiplayer VR game in such a short time, we belived the payoff would be worth the extra challenge.

The first couple days were all about getting arms and interaction working across a network. However, as we got closer and closer to a functional experience we had to start thinking about what the players were going to do together. In our initial testing we had two different colored arms: red and blue. This got us thinking about the political divides in the US and we decided to stretch the game to be about brining a country together as one, not just two people.

We are really happy how the game turned out and hope our message will be recieved by our audience. It is only through compromise that we can unite our country again.
