About halfway through our senior year in high school, Jack thought it was high time we experiment with something other than mobile games. So on one fateful day, he took out his old VR headset, sat down, and pumped out what would eventually mark the beginning of our adventures in virtual reality: Asteroid Escape.

Loosely based off of an old 2D game concept we had, Asteroid Escape features the wildly addicting game mechanic of swinging around with two grappling hooks, allowing the player to experience high-speed thrills and unmatched physical power as they pull themselves through a massive asteroid field. And honestly, that alone was enough to get us hooked on the concept of VR development, as the scale of the world and the immersive experience was unlike anything we'd ever achieved in our past games.

As time went on, we used the project as a way to experiment with the potential of VR. We added the ability to climb on asteroids, as well as bombs which could be grabbed and launched. For an extra challenge, we also added a massive space worm, which really put into perspective how impactful scale could be in a VR setting - something we would take with us into future projects.

The project was so successful that by the end of our senior year, we were given the opportunity to be featured presenters at a showcase for our high school's honors program.
