Gods of Gravity is made in Unity. It uses [Photon](https://www.photonengine.com/en-US/Photon) to provide real time multiplayer and matchmaking and [Vivox](https://unity.com/products/vivox) to provide real time audio chat.

Currently, Gods of Gravity does not collect or store user data.

However, to provide matchmaking and real time networking, Photon stores a unique token created about you which is held by you. Additionally, Photon stores your IP address for the duration of a match and retains this data for a month which it uses to provide real time networking. However, the information stored by Photon is pseudonymised and cannot be used to identify you.

Find more information about Photonâ€™s privacy policy [here](https://dashboard.photonengine.com/en/Account/PrivacyAndCookiePolicy).

To provide real time audio chat, Vivox stores a unique token created about you which is held by you as well as your IP address while in a match. However, Vivox does not store enough information to identify you.
