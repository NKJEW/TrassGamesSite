Gods of Gravity is made in Unity. It uses [Photon](https://www.photonengine.com/en-US/Photon) to provide real time multiplayer and matchmaking and [Vivox](https://unity.com/products/vivox) to provide real time audio chat.

### Gods of Gravity Account

Gods of Gravity automatically creates and updates an account tied to your Oculus ID, a unique string of numbers provided by Oculus. Aside from your Oculus ID which could be used to identify your Oculus account, no information stored in your Gods of Gravity account can be used to identify you.

This account contains the following information:
* Your chosen display name
* Information about your progression like your campaign progress and unlocked gods
* Flags like whether you are a beta tester or are banned from matchmaking

### Photon

To provide matchmaking and real time networking, Photon stores a unique token created about you which is held by you. Additionally, Photon stores your IP address for the duration of a match and retains this data for a month which it uses to provide real time networking. However, the information stored by Photon is pseudonymised and cannot be used to identify you.

### Vivox

To provide real time audio chat, Vivox stores a unique token created about you which is held by you as well as your IP address while in a match. However, Vivox does not store enough information to identify you.
