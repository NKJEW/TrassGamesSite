Gods of Gravity is made in Unity and uses [Photon](https://www.photonengine.com/en-US/Photon) to provide real time multiplayer and matchmaking.

Currently, Gods of Gravity does not collect or store user data.

However, to provide matchmaking and real time networking, Photon stores a unique token created about you which is held by you. Additionally, Photon stores your IP address for the duration of a match and retains this data for a month which it uses to provide real time networking. However, the information stored by Photon is pseudonymised and cannot be used to identify you.
