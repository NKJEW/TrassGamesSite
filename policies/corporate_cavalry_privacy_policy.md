Corporate Cavalry is made in Unity. By default, the game puts you into a group with up to 4 other players, all of whom are in the same class as you.

### Corporate Cavalry Account
Your account is linked to an email address that you provide, which we will never use to contact you unless you specifically request after having forgotten your PIN number. This email is stored using Amazon's [DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/). Other data which is stored on the database includes your provided display name and how far you and your group have gotten through the game.

When the game is complete, your professor will be able to track your progress and contributions by using your email. After a report has been generated, all of your data is deleted permanently from the database.

### Deletion
If you wish to have your personal data deleted, please contact us at somethingtrass@gmail.com.
