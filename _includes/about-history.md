Since our freshman year of high school in 2015, we have worked together on dozens of different games from the hilarious iOS game, Swipe and Shoot, to the ridiculous VR title, Overboard. Since graduating, despite studying at different colleges, we’ve continued developing innovative games together and officially founded Trass Games in 2021. Since then, we’ve began working for clients including the UC Davis Engineering Department while continuing to develop VR games on the side.
